# python-csv
Python tools for manipulating csv files. Some parts (eg pclook.py) inspired by the excellent csvkit (https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit)

Brief summaries of various files:

#Data manipulation
pcsv.py: remove or keep certain rows, remove or keep certain columns, adjust columns or create new columns from old (some similarity to awk)
pcagg.py: run aggregations on the csv (somewhat like GROUP BY in SQL) 
pcjoin.py: run a join on two csv files
pcsort.sh: sort csv files by a column
to_csv.py: import xls files and json files to csv


#Data summaries + viewing
pclook.py: pretty print csv in less
pcgraph.py: quick plotting of one and two dimensional numeric datasets in csv
pctable.py: 
pcset.py: quick 
pcdiff.py: view differences between two csv files
